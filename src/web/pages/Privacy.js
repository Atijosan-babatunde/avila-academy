If you make purchases, we collect certain data about your purchase (such as your name and ZIP code) as necessary to process your order. You must provide certain payment and billing data directly to our payment service providers, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and ZIP code. We may also receive limited information, like the fact that you have a new card and the last four digits of that card, from payment service providers to facilitate payments. For security, Udemy does not collect or store sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit card numbers or card authentication data.
</td>

<td class="table-row-description">
<strong>Instructor Payment Data</strong>

If you are an instructor, you can link your PayPal, Payoneer, or other payment account to the Services to receive payments. When you link a payment account, we collect and use certain information, including your payment account email address, account ID, physical address, or other data necessary for us to send payments to your account. In some instances, we may collect ACH or wire information to send payments to your account. In order to comply with applicable laws, we also work with trusted third parties who collect tax information as legally required. This tax information may include residency information, tax identification numbers, biographical information, and other personal information necessary for taxation purposes. For security, Udemy does not collect or store sensitive bank account information. The collection, use, and disclosure of your payment, billing, and taxation data is subject to the privacy policy and other terms of your payment account provider.

<strong>Data About Your Accounts on Other Services</strong>

<td>
<p>
We may obtain certain information through your social media or other online accounts if they are connected to your Udemy account.

For example, depending on the platform or service we may collect your name, profile picture, account ID number, login email address, location, physical location of your access devices, gender, birthday, and list of friends or contacts.
</p>
<p>
Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you (via your privacy settings) or the platform or service decide to give us.
</p>
<p>
If you access or use our Services through a third-party platform or service, or click on any third-party links, the collection, use, and sharing of your data will also be subject to the privacy policies and other agreements of that third party.

That data is subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated in the official rules of the promotion or in another privacy policy. The data collected will be used to administer the promotion or survey, including for notifying winners and distributing rewards. To receive a reward, you may be required to allow us to post some of your information publicly (like on a winner’s page).

<h3>
1.3 Data From Third Parties
</h3>
<p>
If you are a Udemy for Business enterprise or corporate prospect, we may collect certain business contact information from third-party commercial sources.
</p>
<h2 id="section2">
2. How We Get Data About You
</h2>
<p>
</p><div role="alert" class="alert alert-info">
<div class="content">
We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.
</div>
</div><p></p>
<h3>
2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools
</h3>
<p>
We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including on Udemy. They allow us to remember things about your visits to Udemy, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use. To learn more about cookies, visit https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies.
</p>
<p>
Udemy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, <strong>“Data Collection Tools“</strong>) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>
</p><h3>
2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools
</h3>
<p>
Udemy uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li type="circle">
<u>Strictly Necessary:</u> These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site, provide basic functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. These are required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be unavailable.
</li>
<li type="circle">
<u>Functional:</u> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser and your preferences, provide additional site functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).
</li>
<li type="circle">
<u>Performance:</u> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the Services by providing usage and performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions of Udemy to see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.
</li>
<li type="circle">
<u>Advertising:</u> These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads (on the site and/or other sites) based on things we know about you like your Usage and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.
</li>
<li type="circle">
<u>Social Media:</u> These Data Collection Tools enable social media functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks. These cookies may track a user or device across other sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted advertising purposes.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional. To learn more about managing Data Collection Tools, refer to Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below.

4. Who We Share Your Data With
</h2>
<p>
</p><div role="alert" class="alert alert-info">
<div class="content">
We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, Udemy affiliates, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent.
</div>
</div><p></p>
<p>
We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><u>With Your Instructors:</u>
We share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for educational content you access or request information about, so they can improve their content for you and other students. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to Udemy, and your activities on Udemy. If we collect additional data about you (like age or gender), we may share that too. We will not share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants.
</li>
<li><u>With Other Students and Instructors:</u>
Depending on your settings, your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable.
</li>
<li><u>With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</u>
We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, fraud and abuse prevention, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.
</li>
<li><u>With Udemy Affiliates:</u>
We may share your data within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control to enable or support us in providing the Services.
</li>
<li><u>With Business Partners:</u>
We have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Udemy. For example, we work with Benesse in Japan. Depending on your location, we may share your data with these partners.
</li>
<li><u>With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</u>
As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services like ZoomInfo, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.
</li>
<li><u>To Power Social Media Features:</u>
The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.
</li>
<li><u>To Administer Promotions and Surveys:</u>
We may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.
</li>
<li><u>For Advertising:</u>
If we decide to use an advertising-supported revenue model in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.
</li>
<li><u>For Security and Legal Compliance:</u>
We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:
</li>
<ul>
<li type="circle">
Permitted or required by law;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or
</li>
<li type="circle">
Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Udemy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.
</li>
<li type="circle">
We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.
</li>
</ul>
<li><u>During a Change in Control:</u>
If Udemy undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).
</li>
<li><u>After Aggregation/De-identification:</u>
We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose.
</li>
<li><u>With Your Permission:</u>
With your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2 id="section5">
5. Security
</h2>
<p>
</p><div role="alert" class="alert alert-info">
<div class="content">
We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.
</div>
</div><p></p>
<p>
Udemy takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact our <a href="https://www.udemy.com/support/">Support Team</a> with any concerns.
</p>
<h2 id="section6">
6. Your Rights

<p>
</p><div role="alert" class="alert alert-info">
<div class="content">
You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data.

6.3 Our Policy Concerning Children
</h3>
<p>
We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, but of the required age for consent to use online services where they live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), may not set up an account, but may have a parent or guardian open an account and help them access appropriate content. Individuals younger than the required age for consent to use online services may not use the Services.

</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

</li>
<li>
<strong>“Right to Opt-Out”</strong>
-
You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.

<p>
CCPA has a specific definition of a “sale” and while Udemy does not, in the traditional sense, sell your personal information or the personal information of any of our users, we do use cookies that make non-personally identifiable information available to select third-parties. To opt out of such a “sale,” click on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@udemy.com" id="" class="">privacy@udemy.com</a> or write to us at Udemy, Attn: Privacy/Legal Team, 600 Harrison Street, 3rd floor, San Francisco CA 94107. CCPA allows you to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify you and/or your agent’s identity before fulfilling your request.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, for more information about the personal information we collect and how we collect it, please see the sections above entitled “What Data We Get” and “How We Get Data About You.”
